So today I initiated this diary to document every progress, mistake and
achievement that I make in my learning process.

Today I worked in PY4E in chapter 14: Using Web Services.
In the first autograde where the goal is to parser a XML file and extract some 
numbers, I dint make to it. 

Some kind of error ocurr in the final parsing of the file, when I solve it 
the rest its gonna be easy.

I solved the problem, I saw a solution yesterday and confirmed a suspect, 
the API KEY was causing the troubles for retrieving the info.

I erased that part and the rest was straight forward.

I gonna try the next problem later
