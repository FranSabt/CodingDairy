So today I initiated this diary to document every progress, mistake and
achievement that I make in my learning process.

Today I worked in PY4E in chapter 14: Using Web Services.
In the first autograde where the goal is to parse a XML file 
and extract some numbers, I didn't make to it.

Some kind of error occur in the final parsing of the file, 
when I solve it the rest its gonna be easy.

I solved the problem, I saw a solution yesterday and confirmed a suspect, 
the API KEY was causing the troubles for retrieving the info.

I erased that part and the rest was straight forward.

I gonna try the next problem later

Later: Problem solved! (ExtractingDataFromJSON)
The mayor issue was that the JSON file have 2 main objects and 
I need to traverse through the second that contains multiple sub-objects. 
Normally I will make something like: 

	for (i=0; i < length(ofTheObject); i++)
		object[i][objective]

So the problem was to adapt this algorithm in Python
And a made this: 

	i = 0
	result = 0
	count = 0

	for items in info['comments']:
  		result = result + int(info['comments'][i]['count'])
  		i += 1 #this was necessary because Python don't have i++ sintaxis '¬¬'
			also don't have the third condition in for loops '¬¬'
  		count +=1

Today I just study OOP, I don't get much of the thing and a need to repeat the Quiz.
Also, it occurred to me an app that can be useful in my job tracking the kids at school dismissal time.
"Dismissal is the correct word???"

I only review a few concepts of debugging in TheOdinProject.
My job left me tired today and I don't feel in good shape to code.
BTW my grammar in english it's getting better!

Today I went back to work with "Rock, Scissor, Paper, Lizzard, Spock", 
making more o less 100 lines of code, it didn't see so much now, 
before it was like madness to think in such size.

So, The Odin Project doesn't ask for too much, if enough if the page prompts the results 
but I wanna make a more interactive page.

Another thing of the day, I learned that the "Switch" statement can only accept one parameter,
so when I try to pass two parameters the code didn't work, for that reason, I refactored the code whit "If-Else"
statement and then I learn that the "Break" statement in If-Else break the code.

I'm really tired today but I managed to advance in the JS code for RSPLS, which now tells you when you lose or win. 
And fixed the lack of Tie case with a specific response for each case.
Also I made a Quiz from PY4E.
