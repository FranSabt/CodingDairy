So today I initiated this diary to document every progress, mistake and
achievement that I make in my learning process.

Today I worked in PY4E in chapter 14: Using Web Services.
In the first autograde where the goal is to parse a XML file 
and extract some numbers, I didn't make to i

Some kind of error occur in the final parsing of the file, 
when I solve it the rest its gonna be easy.

I solved the problem, I saw a solution yesterday and confirmed a suspect, 
the API KEY was causing the troubles for retrieving the info.

I erased that part and the rest was straight forward.

I gonna try the next problem later

Later: Problem solved! (ExtractingDataFromJSON)
The mayor issue was that the JSON file have 2 main objects and 
I need to traverse through the second that contains multiple sub-objects. 
Normally I will make something like: 

	for (i=0; i < length(ofTheObject); i++)
		object[i][objective]

So the problem was to adapt this algorithm in Python
And a made this: 

	i = 0
	result = 0
	count = 0

	for items in info['comments']:
  		result = result + int(info['comments'][i]['count'])
  		i += 1 #this was necessary because Python don't have i++ sintaxis '¬¬'
			also don't have the third condition in for loops '¬¬'
  		count +=1
